\subsection*{Wildcards}

\begin{tabular}{l   l}
    \textasciitilde & expand to user\textquotesingle s home dir \\
    ? & match a single char\\
    * & match string of chars\\
    {[ \,\,\, ]} & any char in set\\
    {[! \,\, ]} & any char not in set\\
    \{ \,\,\, \} & expands to all alternatives \\
    \textbackslash <char>  & escape <char> to normal \\
    \textquotesingle <wild> \textquotesingle & wildcard $\to$ literal \\
    \textbackslash & line continuation \\
\end{tabular}

\textit{Examples:}\\
\entry{35mm}{[abc]}{set match}\\
\entry{35mm}{[a-c]}{same as above}\\
\entry{35mm}{\textasciitilde alice}{alice\textquotesingle s home}\\
\entry{35mm}{ls *.\{c,h,o\}}{C program files}\\
\entry{35mm}{find . -name \textquotesingle *.c \textquotesingle }{{\footnotesize delay wildcd expand}}\\
\entry{35mm}{echo \textquotesingle 2 * 3 > 5\textquotesingle}{wildcd $\to$ literals}\\

\subsection*{Quoting Rules}

\textit{Single quotes around strings suppress all wildcard expansion; double quotes suppress everything but \$\{\dots\} expansion. In general, use single quotes, except when requiring dollar-sign expansion.}

\subsection*{Control Keys}

\textit{Use }\textbf{trap}\textit{ to handle signals, which are issued like:}\\
\begin{tabular}{l  l}
    ctrl-c & stop current command \\
    ctrl-d & end of input \\ 
    ctrl-\textbackslash & quit \\ 
    ctrl-s & halt output to screen \\ 
    ctrl-q & restart output to screen \\ 
    ctrl-? & erase last character \\ 
    ctrl-u & erase entire command line \\ 
    ctrl-z & suspend current command \\ 
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Hot Keys (\say{bindings})}

\textbf{bind}\textit{ ties key sequences to certain activities. System-wide bindings are in }\texttt{/etc/inputrc}\textit{ and user-specific in }\texttt{\textasciitilde/.inputrc}\textit{. These customizations control the command-line interpreter, which is named }\textbf{readline}.\\
\entry{35mm}{bind \textquotesingle \textquotedbl \textbackslash C-t\textquotedbl : \textquotedbl test\textquotedbl  \textquotesingle}{bind string test}\\
\entry{35mm}{bind -x \textquotesingle \textquotedbl \textbackslash C-t\textquotedbl : \textquotedbl date\textquotedbl  \textquotesingle}{bind e\ul{x}ecutable}\\
\entry{35mm}{bind -l}{list bindable f\textquotesingle ns}\\
\entry{35mm}{bind -P}{list all bindings}\\
